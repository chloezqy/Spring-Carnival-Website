                <h4>Treasurer</h4>
                <p>I am a senior majoring in Information Systems and Drama: Production Management through the BXA program. I first joined SCC my freshman year on the Parking and Security committees. I wanted to continue help improve Carnival and finances are an area of expertise so I became Treasurer. I was previously Secretary/Treasurer and currently am Financial Advisor for Student Dormitory Council. I have also been a part of Carnival through AB Tech and Student/Residential Life as an RA for the previous two years.</p>

                <p>I am a senior Electrical and Computer Engineering major who loves booth (almost too much?)! I was a booth chair for my sorority for the previous two years, but have been obsessed with booth since I was a freshman. I am so excited to see what all the different organizations end up building, and to be a part of one of Carnegie Mellon's weirdest (but also best) tradition!</p>

                <h4>Advisor</h4>
                <p>This is my second year at CMU, and my first year working with Carnival! I couldn’t be more excited to work with the Executive Board of Spring Carnival Committee on issues of safety and logistics, and serve as the staff liaison to other administrative departments that act as stakeholders for the weekend’s many events. In addition to Carnival, I also advice Dancers’ Symposium, plan the annual welcome back event Janufest, coordinate the Spring Leadership Workshop, and coordinate the Student Organization Award Recognition process.</p>
