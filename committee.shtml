                    Administration minor. This is her fourth year on Spring
                    Carnival Committee and first time serving as the Chair.
                    She am thrilled to PLAN-(et earth) this carnival. The
                    best part is all the excitement that comes to campus
                    during Spring Carnival!</p>

                    she wouldn't have it any other way. She feels that
                    being part of the committee has been instrumental for
                    her life at CMU. She loves watching students pour their
                    love and dedication into their booths and can't wait to
                    see what they have in store for us this year!</p>

                    her favorite parts about CMU! Every Carnival, she
                    looks forward to seeing all of the teamwork and

                    final carnival. Rahin suggests if you had to do one
                    thing during carnival, it's to get the fried oreos from
                    the APhiO booth :)</p>
