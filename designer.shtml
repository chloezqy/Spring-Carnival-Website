                    <h3>Andrew Chan</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Andrew is a current Junior in Architecture, HCI, and Game Design. He is from NYC and he really likes to break the norms of what is declared possible; he knows it doesn’t hurt to at least try and fail rather than watch and ponder on the possibilities. Beyond designing, he is super interested in tinkering and often is working on a multitude of physical prototypes projects and loves to help out the community/creator’s space that he works for, IDEATE, and make new friends along the way. Also, he loves being a photographer and going to the gym.
