I have worked on MCS booth the past two years and was on booth committee last year.

                <h4>Treasurer</h4>
                <p>I am a senior majoring in Information Systems and Drama: Production Management through the BXA program. I started with Spring Carnival Committee in freshman year on what was then known as the Parking and Security subcommittees, later it became the operations committee. I worked a lot with the coordinators, the people who are in charge/supervise midway. I wanted to continue help carnival grow and improve, so I did it from an area I know best, finances, and became treasurer. I was previously Secretary/Treasurer for the Student Dormitory Council and am currently the Financial Advisor for them. Additionally, I have been a part of Carnival through AB Tech and Student/Residential Life as an RA for the previous two years.</p>
